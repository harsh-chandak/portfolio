      🐴 Taming Complexity and operations, from sales to dispatch.
      🏗️ Built inventory logic that auto-rebalanced stock across warehouses, yes, it had opinions.
      📊 Designed BI dashboards that told stories, not just numbers (hello, exec summaries).
      🛠️ Production planning? Gantt-inspired timelines that respected both dev cycles and machine breakdowns.
      🧠 Assumed failure as the default, built like it.
      ✅ If you gave me your ops chaos today, I’d model it by Monday and stress test it by Friday.

      🛒 It isn't “build a store.” It is: make commerce sing.
      🧱 Shipped 15+ full-stack storefronts. From fashion, accessories, to hardware and spare parts.
      💸 Integrated payments (Razorpay/Stripe) with grace, retries, refunds, and regrets included.
      📦 Backend: custom schemas per vertical. Frontend: fast enough to feel native.
      📈 Dashboards that helped sellers sell, not confuse them.
      🤹 Juggled orders, stock, delivery, roles, and edge cases without dropping the vibe.`

      ⚡ Real-time isn't speed, it's trust. And I build like I mean it.
      🚚 Location tracking with socket + fallback polling, accurate and battery-friendly.
      💬 Chat apps with sticky state, retry queues, and graceful reconnects.
      ⛑️ Built for poor networks. Always. Because people use phones, not fiber.
      🧘 UI that reacts fast but never freaks out. Real-time should feel smooth, not sweaty.
      🧪 Debugged packet drops with browser tabs and sheer will.

      🎓 Learning platforms are a mess. I made them less so.
      📚 Built progress trackers that knew when to chill (don’t panic over skipped quizzes).
      🚀 Admin tools that didn’t require a handbook, drag-drop, done.
      🕵️ Real-time session tracking without WebSocket meltdowns.
      📦 Modular content pipelines, one backend to teach them all.
      🤔 Asked myself: “Would a teacher actually use this?”, and designed from that answer.
